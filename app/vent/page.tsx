                    The Problem

                <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                <p>
                Tourists and vacationers in Asturias often struggle to discover local events near their location. Without a centralized source of reliable information, they rely on word-of-mouth, risking missed opportunities for events they might enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                Event planners also face challenges, lacking a modern and effective platform to promote their activities. Traditional methods, such as posters or outdated websites, limit their reach and create barriers for new or smaller-scale events.

                Ven-T is an event-listing app designed to connect people with events around them while promoting tourism in rural Asturias. The app provides a user-friendly platform for tourists and locals to explore events and helps event planners reach a broader audience through modern features such as:
                </p>
                <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                  <li>A searchable map of event locations.</li>

                <p>
                Ven-T aimed to fill the gap in the market by offering a seamless experience for both users and event organizers.

                Through user interviews, several key patterns emerged:

                <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                  <li>People often rely on acquaintances or local contacts to learn about traditional events.</li>

                <p className='projectSectionRight'>
                While platforms like Fiestas de Asturias and Pella de Ocio share a similar focus, they lacked essential features like maps or event-saving options. Indirect competitors like Google or Eventbrite provide limited information or are tailored more toward ticketed events. This gap reinforced the need for a modern and localized solution.
