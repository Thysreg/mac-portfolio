                  <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                    <p>Asturias is rich in tradition, music and festivals, but if you donâ€™t know someone local, chances are youâ€™ll miss them. While exploring the area myself, I noticed how hard it was to find current events unless you relied on posters or heard about them through word of mouth.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, event organizers, especially those running smaller or newer gatherings, lacked the tools to promote their events effectively. Existing platforms were outdated, limited in functionality, or aimed more at ticketed, large-scale shows.</p>
                    <p>Ven-T emerged from a simple idea: create a centralized, intuitive platform where anyone could discover what was happening around them.</p>

                <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                  <p>To understand both sides of the problem, I interviewed potential users, tourists, locals and organizers. Across the board, the patterns were clear:</p>
                  <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                    <li>Most people learned about events through personal connections or luck.</li>
                    <li>Searching online wasnâ€™t helpful, information was outdated or scattered.</li>
                    <li>Users wanted variety: not just big festivals, but cultural events, workshops and gatherings.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                    <p>I also analyzed local competitors like Fiestas de Asturias and Pella de Ocio, as well as larger discovery platforms like Eventbrite or Google Maps. While the latter offered general event listings, none addressed the specific needs of rural tourism or community-based events in Asturias. Most lacked even basic features like maps, filters, or saved favorites.</p>
                    <p>This reinforced our opportunity: to create something local, modern and easy to use.</p>

                  <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                    <p>The core value of Ven-T was clarity and usefulness, for both tourists and event organizers. I focused on three key features:</p>
                    <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
                      <li>A <b>map-based interface</b> to visualize events by proximity</li>
                      <li>A simple <b>save-to-favorites</b> system</li>
                      <li>Smart <b>filtering</b> that helped users find events based on time, location, or type</li>

                  <div className='projectSectionRight'>
                    <p>To keep the MVP realistic, I created a Feature Prioritization Matrix, balancing user needs with technical feasibility. Some initial ideas (like gamified event badges or calendar integrations) were intentionally deferred to keep the scope tight.</p>

                    <p>Early sketches explored different layouts and flows, but the first prototypes leaned too much into style over usability. Through testing and feedback, I gradually stripped the UI back, keeping only what helped users navigate quickly and confidently.</p>

                    <p>Using Flutter, I developed the mobile app to match the designs as closely as possible, while optimizing for speed and simplicity. Some design adjustments were made during development to improve load times and offline performance.</p>
                    <p>A beta version of the app was released for Android and iOS and shared among early testers, who used it during the local spring festival season. Their feedback helped refine event listings, filters and interaction flows.</p>

                    <p>Ven-T taught me how to move a product from idea to execution with clarity and constraint. It was a crash course in balancing what users need with whatâ€™s realistic to build, and how to validate assumptions quickly before getting lost in extra features.</p>
                    <p>It also reinforced how much <b>impact simple, focused design</b> can have, especially in places where digital tools havenâ€™t caught up to the richness of real-world experiences. Sometimes, just helping people <b>know whatâ€™s happening around them</b> is enough to bring a town to life.</p>
